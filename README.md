# 🌿 Core Java – Practice Paths

This repository contains my **Core Java learning journey**, organized in a logical order from basics to projects.
Each file represents a concept or practice program.
My goal is to build a strong foundation before moving into advanced topics like OOP, collections, and System Design.
