            case "Saturday", "Sunday" -> "6am";

}


 INSTEAD OF USING SYSTEM.OUT.PRINTLN LIKE A OLD METHOD OR MULTIPLE ASSIGNING VALUE
 THE NEW AND BEST POSSIBLE WAY IS USING STRING RESULT VARIABLE
 ITS AN NEW METHOD FOR SWITCH STATEMENT
 NEW METHOD REPLACES BREAKS WITH A RIGHT ARROW
 IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE ARROW, THEN YOU CAN USE COLON BUT YOU NEED TO MENTION YIELD
 Since it's an expression you need to put semicolon in the end



        switch(day) // ITS AN OLD METHOD OF SWITCH STATEMENT
        {
            case "Saturday", "Sunday" :
                System.out.println("6am");
                break;


            case "Monday" :
                System.out.println("7am");
                break;


            default:
                System.out.println("8am");

        }

         */
    }
