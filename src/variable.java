    Variable = a reusable container for a value
               a variable behaves as if it was the value it contains

     */

    /*


    primitive = simple values stored directly in memory (stack)
    reference = memory address (stack) that points to the (heap)


    more detailed of primitive type....
    Think of it like writing a number directly on a sticky note
    The value itself (like 42) is stored directly in memory (stack)
    Quick to access because it's right there
    Examples: int x = 5;, boolean isActive = true;


    more detailed of reference type .....
    Think of it like having a sticky note with an address that points to a box
    The stack (sticky note) holds the address/location
    he actual object/value is stored in the heap (the box)
    Examples: String name = "John";, int[] numbers = {1,2,3};


    primitive vs reference
    ---------    ---------
    int          string
    double       array
    char         object
    boolean

    2 steps to create a variable
    ----------------------------
    1) DECLARATION
    2) ASSIGNMENT
